## Creating a React app

In this tutorial we will be using [Vite](https://vite.dev/), a fast frontend build tool. We are using Vite over Create React App as CRA has been deprecated as of February, 2025.

To scaffold a new Vite project, use the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm create vite@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn create vite
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm create vite
```

```bash bun
bun create vite
```

</CodeGroup>

Then simply follow the prompts to bootstrap a React project.

## Deploying a React app

Nubo supports React out of the box. With some minor configurations, you can launch your React project today.

### Transpilation

React is transpiled into plain JavaScript that browsers can run. If you are using Vite, your code is transpiled using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) during development and bundled into static assets using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for production.

When your application is being deployed on Nubo. We will detect that there is a build script in your `package.json` which usually looks something like:

```json
"build": "vite build"
```

If this line is detected, it will run this script which transpiles your code using Vite.

### Configuring a web server

Once we have our static assets (generated by the build process), we need to setup a server that will actually handling serving these assets to our end user.

You have a few options. Of which are described below:

1. Follow the [static site](/languages/static) documentation to create the necessary Nginx or Apache configurations.
2. Use [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) or [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) packages

In this tutorial, we will be using the `serve` package. We decided to go with `serve` because it is far more simple than setting up an Nginx server.

#### Installing the `serve` package

Firstly, we will want to install the `serve` package by running:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install serve
```
```bash yarn
yarn add serve
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add bash
```
```bash bun
bun add serve
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Configuring the `start` script

A start script in the `package.json` will tell Nubo to run this as the default process for the container. In this case, we will specify the start script to start up our HTTP server and serve our static assets.

Add the following start script to your `package.json`:

```json package.json
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "start": "serve ./dist" <-- Add this line for Vite
  },
  ...
```

### Push changes to GitHub

Stage all changes:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit changes:

```bash
git commit -m "build: add Nubo deploy config"
```

Push to GitHub:

```bash
git push
```

### Deploying on the Nubo dashboard

You are now ready to deploy with Nubo. Simply head to the Nubo dashboard and perform the following actions.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create or select a project">
        <Frame>
            ![Select or create project](/images/select-project.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open the new Frame modal">
        Click on the "+ Frame" butotn
        <Frame>
            ![Frame button section of dashboard](/images/create-frame.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Choose repository and configure port">
        Select your repository from the list of repos that are displayed. Then, if applicable, configure your port to match the port that your server is listening on.
        <Frame>
            ![Select repository section](/images/select-repository.png)
        </Frame>
        <Note>Serve listens on port 3000 by default. So be sure to change the "Application Port".</Note>
    </Step>
</Steps>
