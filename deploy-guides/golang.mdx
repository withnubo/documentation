Golang is support with Nubo out of the box, with no configuration necessarily required.

## Creating a basic Go HTTP server

In this demonstration, we will be creating a very basic Golang HTTP server.

## Going live with Nubo

            ![Frame button section of dashboard](/images/create-frame.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Choose repository and configure port">
        Select your repository from the list of repos that are displayed. Then, if applicable, configure your port to match the port that your server is listening on.

        </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting a custom Go version

By default, Nubo will determine the version of Golang to use based on your `go.mod` file. But, in the event that you need to manually specify the version. Create `project.toml` file like below:

```toml
[ _ ]
schema-version = "0.2"

[[ io.buildpacks.build.env ]]
  name="BP_GO_VERSION"
  value="1.14.1" # CUSTOM VERSION HERE
```
