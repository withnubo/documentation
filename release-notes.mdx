Let's break down these changes:

Ooooh, wowww. What a clean and sharp new design. It nicely demonstrates the steps in getting a product launched with each tabs! These tabs visually show each step by using gifs.

### Documentation

Writing documentation is always so much fun! Will many read it, probably not. But hey, at least it's here. We have created guides for each language and framework that we support.

We will be expanding and adjusting the documentation as needed. The docs are available now on the site that you are currently on. Simply click "Documentation" at the top left.

If you notice any issues or want to contribute. Submit a pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/withnubo/documentation).

### Is it down or just me?

Stay up to date on the status of Nubo with our brand new [status page](https://withnubo.statuspage.io/). There's not really much more to discuss about this.
