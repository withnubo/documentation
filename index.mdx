Nubo was founded to be the go-to place for all things DevOps. A tool to release software fast, iterate faster, and scale effortlessly. Whether you are deploying a small portfolio site or a highly complex micro-service driven platform, Nubo eliminates the bottlenecks.

## Nubo is changing cloud infrastructure
Changing the way that developers interact with infrastructure is at the core of Nuboâ€™s mission. We believe that current solutions require too much energy and yield unsatisfying results. Results that lead to hours of wasted time in the terminal printing environment variables, or skimming a config file for the 100th time.

We also feel that the market is too fragmented. Nubo offers a platform that encompasses the entire development lifecycle. Instead of using 4+ different types of applications, use one. Go from juggling multiple different applications to one.

1. Software deployment (built-in CI/CD pipelines and no Dockerfiles)
2. Development environments (Dev, Staging, Prod, etc.)
3. Infrastructure management and security
4. Logging and monitoring

Focus on what matters - creating and building better software, not on servers, scaling, or `ImagePullBackOff` errors.
