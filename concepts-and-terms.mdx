## Key concepts

The fundementals

### DevOps

DevOps combines Software Development and IT Operations to streamline and automate the software delivery process, enabling a consistent, fast, and reliable development cycle. Nubo provides built-in CI/CD pipelines and monitoring solutions to simplify software deployment.

### Cloud infrastructure

Cloud infrastructure consists of hardware and services enabling on-demand cloud computing, using virtualized servers managed by a cloud provider. Nubo offers flexible, on-demand compute managed and hosted in our data centers.

### Containerization

Containerization involves packaging software applications and their dependencies into containers to ensure consistency across different systems and environments. Nubo transforms applications into OCI-compliant images deployable virtually anywhere.

## Terminology

The phrases and terms that Nubo use in hierarchical order

### Projects

Projects are the initial starting place for that next big idea. It includes everything that makes your application - think landing pages, dashboards, APIs, and databases.

### Spaces

Spaces represent different development environments aligning with the development lifecycle. One may create a development, staging, and production Space that have independent resources running on them.

Use case: Spaces allow for previewing or testing changes before hitting production.

### Frames

Frames represent the actual resource that is running and they exist on a Projectâ€™s Space. Frames are connected to a git repository and are assigned a domain upon their creation. Deployment triggers can be setup for CI/CD.
